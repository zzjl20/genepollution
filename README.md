If 1 edited gene join the human gene pool, what is the result after generations? <br>
This is a simulator. <br>

Initial conditions:
1. Normal man: 20000, Normal woman 20000, Gene pulluted man: 1, Gene pulluted woman: 0
2. One man and one woman will generate 3 children(next generation) and these couple will not involve next round children generation<br>
3. The child will 50% to be a boy or a girl, independently.<br>
4. If normal gene meet normal gene, the children will be normal(pure)<br>
5. If a normal gene meet an edited gene, the children will be edited.(pollute)<br>
6. If an edit gene meet an edited gene, no child (harm)<br>

Conclusion: This gene is too strong. The human end at 23th generation.<br> The posterity always carry the pollut gene so the pollut gene will conquer normal gene, always.

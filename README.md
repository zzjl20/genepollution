Simulate one carriers of edited heritable gene affection on generation. 
This is a simulator. 
If 1 edited gene join the human gene pool, what is the result after generations?
Assume "M" for man, "W" for woman. "1" for normal gene, "2" for edited gene.
Assume one man and one woman will generate 3 children(next generation). 
The childeren have 50% to be a boy or a girl, independently.
If normal gene meet normal gene, the children will be normal(pure)
If a normal gene meet an edited gene, the children will be edited.(pollute)
If an edit gene meet an edited gene, no child (harm)

Conclusion: This gene is too strong. 
The gene conquer normal gene every time so the posterity always carry this gene
